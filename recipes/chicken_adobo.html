            Combine Chicken and Marinade ingredients in a bowl.

            Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove chicken
            from marinade (reserve marinade) and place in the pan.
            Sear both sides until browned - about 1 minute on each side.
            Do not cook the chicken all the way through.
        </p>

            Remove chicken skillet and set aside.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Heat the remaining oil in skillet.Add garlic and onion,
            cook 1 1/2 minutes.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar and black pepper.
            Bring it to a simmer then turn heat down to medium high.
            Simmer 5 minutes.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Add chicken smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20 to
            25 minutes (no need to stir), turning chicken at around 15
            minutes, until the sauce reduces down to a thick jam-like syrup.
        </p>
    </li>

            If the sauce isn't thick enough, remove chicken onto a plate
            and let the sauce simmer by itself - it will thicken much
            quicker - then return chicken to the skillet to coat in the glaze.
        </p>

            Coat chicken in glaze then serve over rice. Pictured in post as
